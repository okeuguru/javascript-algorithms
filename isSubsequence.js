// Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and
// checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence
// of the characters in the second string. In other words, the function
// should check whether the characters in the first string appear
// somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.

isSubsequence("hello", "hello world");
isSubsequence("sing", "sting");
isSubsequence("abc", "abracadabra");
isSubsequence("abc", "acb");
